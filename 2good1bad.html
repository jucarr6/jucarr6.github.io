  <h1>2 Good Websites...and 1 Very Bad One</h1>


  <ul>
    <li><a href="http://cyclemon.com/shop/index.html"> Cyclemon Posters</a></li>
    <p>I find the layout of this poster shop to be quite appealing to outside viewers. The color arrangement is aesthetically pleasing and the page is easy to navigate. This site is simple, yet fancy enough to where it presents itself as professional. After inspecting the source code, I can see the HTML is clean and up to date with common standards. It is easy to read and well organized. Because this is a poster shop with screenprints, the website is not too complicated, making it quite easy to navigate. Some might not enjoy the scrolling transitions, but I find them creative and trendy for this particular website; it sets them apart from other small shops. Overall, I believe this company did a wonderful job of producing a successful website that represents its brand voice well through its character, stylish color, and up-to-date code. While it all looks well done, one thing I noticed is their website is not secure, making this not the best option to actually purchase a poster from.</p>

    <li><a href="https://www.everlane.com/"> Everlane</a></li>
    <p>Everlane is a highend hipster brand known for its ethical background and trendy clothes. They value quality, not quantity and set a high standard for their brand. After reviewing their website, I believe their website represents these values well. The colors are modern and are presented in an aesthetically pleasing way on their site. The spacing and layout of this website is beautifully put together, and unfortunately makes me spend more time and money than I should on it. The code appears to be written in a form of HTML I have yet to see including many function and variable, and if/else statements. I am aware of this based on my Python experience, but had yet to see it in a website source code. Everlane’s website is easy to navigate whether a customer is searching for a particular item or information on the the company’s background. Once again, I really admire the color balance and gentle feel this website gives off, nothing about is overwhelming. It is professional, pleasing, and provides all it needs to those scrolling through their page.</p>

    <li><a href="https://www.art.yale.edu/">Garbage</a></li>
    <p>This website brings me humor as it displays content that is organized poorly, uncentered on the screen, lacks a consistent color scheme, and unveils too many unnecessary fonts. From the first click, anyone can tell this website is poorly done and was potentially created as a joke. After inspecting this website, the elements tab exhibits the HTML code, which happens to be quite unprofessional. The code did not have too many lines of code either, most of them were div id’s, but there is nothing exceptional about it. After also peeking at the console tab, it displays warnings that Google Analytics is not configured, there are AudioContext errors, and multiple flags about DevTools failing to load the source map. Back to discussing the display format, this Yale School of Art provides a horrendous background image that is unsatisfying to the eye based on how chaotic and blurry it is. What also bothers me is how uneven the layout of every textbox, image, column, font, and words are. The home site also includes an unnecessary amount of scrolling and the links to connecting pages are just as poorly designed. Hardly anything about this page is tolerable, but at least I did not see too much comic sans displayed. </p>

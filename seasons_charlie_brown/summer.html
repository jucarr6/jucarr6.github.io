<p>Summer is the warmest season of the year, falling between spring and autumn. Temperatures over the period differ based upon the location on the Earth; regions near the equator are typically warmer than those lying near the poles. This is because, due to the curve of the Earth, these places receive the most sunlight, according to Pedagogy in Action. The areas around the Earth's poles also have ice, which reflect a lot of the sun's rays. </p>

<p>The summer equinox occurs when the sun passes directly above the equator because of the tilt of the Earth. When the seasons are based on the Earth's position in relation to the sun, it is called astronomical summer. In the Northern Hemisphere, astronomical summer happens on or around June 21. The North Pole is tilted at the greatest angle toward the sun at this time. In the Southern Hemisphere, summer occurs on or around Dec. 22, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), when the South Pole is tilted toward the sun.  </p>

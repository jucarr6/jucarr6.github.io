<h1>Hosts Review</h1>

<h2><a href= "http://www.godaddy.com">GoDaddy</a></h2>
  <ul>
    <li> GoDaddy provides a handful amount of domain services and claims to
    grant the lowest fees in the industry and is one of the best for non-metered
     bandwidth. It also equips users with free templates and has an overall
     4.5/5 stars based off of 30010 reviews.</li>
  </ul>

<h2><a href= "http://www.bluehost.com">Blue Host</a></h2>
  <ul>
    <li> Blue Host fits the shoes for those who are beginners in the
    web design world by providing few service options at a reasonable price
    and making website building creative and easy. If one needs assistance,
  Blue Host provides expert support 24/7.  </li>
  </ul>

<h2><a href= "http://www.greengeeks.com">Green Geeks</a></h2>
  <ul>
    <li> Green Geeks is the World's #1 Green Energy webhost that makes a positive impact on
      the environment starting at only $2.95 per month. Not only is Green Geeks
      recognized at a global level by the Environmental Protection Agency, but
      they also plant a tree for every hosting account provision on their platform,
       giving back one tree at a time to improve their carbon footprint.
      </li>
    </ul>

<p>Personally, I would choose Blue Host as my webhost as for it is beginner friendly,
is widely known, is pretty inexpensive, and provides me with webdesign templates to easily
spark creativity and produce aesthetically pleasing websites.  </p>

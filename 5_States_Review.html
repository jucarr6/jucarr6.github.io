<h1>5 States Review</h1>
<ol>
<li><h3><a href= "http://www.nebraska.gov">Nebraska</a></h3></li>

   <p>Of the 5 states to analyze, Nebraska's appears as the most appealing to the
  eye at first glance. I admire the color balance, the modern look,the use of shapes, and the chosen
  font of this website. The dropdown menu is organized well and is easy to navigate
  for the user. After looking at this sites code, it seems that "Div" is one of the
  most common functions applied throughout the various pages. Instead of overwhelming
 the user with content on one page, Nebraska.gov constructs mulitiple links for
just about any information one would need to learn about the state.</p>

<li><h3><a href= "https://www.myflorida.com/">Florida</a></h3></li>
    <p>Coming in 2nd place of these 5 states, I would vote for Florida's website
      as next best based on the simplicity of the website in terms of content, amount
      of links, and the number of images. Something I noticed is this website does not
      have any dropdown menus and puts it into the users hands by using the massive
      search bar to find what they are looking for. This allows for a basic website
      appearance, but anchors a lot of trust in the search bar to lead to the desired
      information page.

<li><h3><a href= "https://delaware.gov/">Delaware</a></h3></li>

<p> 3rd on my ranking I would list Delaware. I enjoy the gentle bold blue color
scheme with the other pale colors, it's a good combination. I think this website
provides the perfect amount of content spread accross the page, however I am critcal
of the amount of scrolling the user has to do on the main page. It would be better
to separate them into a few links leading to different pages. </p>


<li><h3><a href= "https://www.illinois.gov/">Illinois</a></h3></li>

<p> Next up I would place Illinois, mainly because it is slightly more modern than
the remaining states. I would argue this website is too chaotic in terms of colors
and content. I am not a big fan of the display in terms of the organization, and I wish
there was a dropdown menu. My last critique is that when the user clicks on the
links anchored on the main page, those sites are loaded with an abundant amount of images
and too many colors that do not correlate well together.   </p>



<li><h3><a href= "https://alaska.gov/">Alaska</a></h3></li>

<p> Coming in last place out of the 5 states has to be Alaska. The website looks
as if it were created in 2010 and hasn't been updated since. The font is not very appealing
and there is way too much text and it is not spaced out well. The links are too
close to each other and the main page is too overcrowded.  </p>
